*{{{./javafuse: error while loading shared libraries: libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory}}}*

The shared library libjvm.so could not be found. Add the folder containing that file to the environment vairable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. See nullfs_mount.sh for an example of how to tackle this.

*{{{./javafuse: error while loading shared libraries: libjavafuse.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory}}}*


The shared library libjavafuse.so could not be found. Add the "build" folder to the environment vairable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. See nullfs_mount.sh for an example of how to tackle this.

*{{{WARNING in native method: JNI call made with exception pending}}}<br>
{{{javafuse: src/native/fsClass.c:35: init_fsClass: Assertion `fuseSt.fsClass != ((void *)0)' failed.}}}*


The Java class implementing the file system could not be found. Either an incorrect name for the package/class name was specified, or the class was not compiled. For instance, to compile the NullFS filesystem, do:

	cd fs<br>
	make

Note that the "javafuse" executable must be passed the -C flag with a PackageName/ClassName value (see nullfs_mount.sh). Alternatively, the CLASSNAME option can be set in the config file for the filesystem (see fs/nullfs/nullfs.config).
